# SmartBuilding application: Smart Air Conditioning System

Repository for an interactive multiuser IoT prototype for controlling air conditioning inside apartments.
The repository contains:

- End device configuration (ESP32 board)
- Edge layer configuration (Raspberry PI4 master-slave architecture, communicating through Node-RED flows. Interactive Telegram bot integration)
- Edge intelligence (Tensorflow application to build a network and predict temperature and humidity value from a given dataset)
- Edge Cloud Sim (Simulation of the architecture and comparisons on EdgeCloud, OnlyEdge and OnlyCloud proposal)
