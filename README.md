# SmartBuilding application: Smart Air Conditioning System

Repository for an interactive multiuser IoT prototype for controlling air conditioning inside apartments.
The repository contains:

- End device configuration (ESP32 board)
- Node-RED (Configuration of a Raspberry PI4 master-slave architecture through Node-RED flows. Interactive Telegram bot implementation)
- Edge intelligence (Tensorflow application to build a recurrent neural network and to predict temperature and humidity values from a given dataset)
- Edge Cloud Sim (Simulation of the architecture and comparisons on EdgeCloud, OnlyEdge and OnlyCloud proposal)
